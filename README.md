### Country Visa-Free Access Dashboard Project
---
I developed a visual dashboard to analyze and present insights on visa-free access rankings for countries worldwide. 
The dashboard categorizes countries into ranked groups and provides key statistical summaries to facilitate an understanding of global mobility trends.

### Key Features:
---
Country Grouping: Segmented countries into six rank-based groups:
Group 1: Ranks 1st–19th
Group 2: Ranks 20th–39th
Group 3: Ranks 40th–59th
Group 4: Ranks 60th–79th
Group 5: Ranks 80th–99th
Group 6: Ranks 100th–106th

### Visa-Free Access Metrics:
---
* Calculated and displayed the average visa-free countries accessible per group.
* Analyzed and visualized the median visa-free access for each group to highlight distribution tendencies.
